************************execution context*****************
=>executon context means how js run a code and hoe it execute it.

                 1. global execution context
                 2. function execution context
                 3.eval execution context (almost same as global)

Note: js is single threaded dynamic programming language

=> code runs in two phases:
                         1. memory creation phase or creation phase: 
                                      => memory allocated to all the variables
                                      => no any opeartion perform in this phase
 
                         2. executoin phase
