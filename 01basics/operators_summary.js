/* data types are of two types on the basis of
   1. how to store the data and,
   2. How to access that data

types :
      1. Primitive (call by value): if use the primitive data types
         the we get the copy of that data, we 
         don't get the original data and the chages we
         done made in copy only not in original
    example: total 7
             Strings, Number, Boolean, Symbol
             bigint,null, undefined

      2. non-primitive( refernce): orignal data refernce
          is give
         ex. Array, Function, Objects */
